# Pytorch implementation of the paper "Creativity: Generating Diverse Questions using Variational Autoencoders" https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03493

I will try to build and train a model that replicates the results of the paper, by attaining to what specified in the paper first and then explore some variants to improve the performance. 

Compatible with pytorch 1.13.1 and python 3.10.9 

I will train the algorithm on the same dataset mentioned in the paper

TODOs:
- build dataset and dataloader for the dataset mentioned in the paper
- train the model on the complete dataset using resnet18 as backbone
- train the same model but with a variant of backbone, using a pretrained vision transformer
